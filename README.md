Backend Engineering Assignment

Topic: Authentication, Authorization & Secure API Design with Node.js

Stack Requirements

Use the following technologies:

Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB + Mongoose

dotenv

Morgan

Scenario

You were hired to build the backend for a startup called VaultPass — a platform where users can create private notes and manage team access securely.

The company recently suffered a security breach because:

users could access other users’ data,

admins had too much unrestricted power,

tokens never expired,

and sensitive routes were exposed publicly.

Your task is to redesign the backend properly.

Assignment Requirements

Project Setup
Initialize a professional backend structure.

Your project must include:

Environment variable management with dotenv

Request logging with Morgan

Proper folder structure

Error handling middleware

MongoDB connection setup

Authentication System
Implement:

User Registration

A user should register with:

fullName

email

password

role

Rules

email must be unique

password must be hashed

role can only be:

user

moderator

admin

User Login

Users should log in using:

email

password

Return:

JWT token

user information (excluding password)

Authorization Twist
Implement role-based access control.

Routes

Public Route

GET /api/public/message

Response:

{ "message": "This route is public" }

Protected Route

GET /api/user/profile

Only logged-in users can access it.

Moderator Route

GET /api/moderator/reports

Accessible only by:

moderator

admin

Admin Route

DELETE /api/admin/user/:id

Only admins can:

delete users

BUT admins cannot delete themselves

(Yes, this is intentional.)

The Twist
Implement account locking.

If a user enters the wrong password:

5 consecutive times,

within 10 minutes,

their account should be locked for:

15 minutes.

During lock:

login must fail even if password becomes correct.

Store this properly in MongoDB.

Token Security
JWT tokens must:

expire in 1 hour

fail properly when expired

return meaningful error responses

Suspicious Activity Logger
Create middleware that logs:

failed logins

forbidden route access attempts

deleted accounts

Store logs in MongoDB.

Suggested fields:

action

user

ipAddress

timestamp

Bonus Twist (Important)
Create a route:

POST /api/admin/promote/:id

Rules:

only admins can promote users

admins CANNOT promote another admin

moderators cannot promote anyone

users cannot access the route

Deliverables
Students must submit:

GitHub Repository
With:

clean commits

meaningful README

Postman Collection
Include:

all endpoints

example requests

example responses

Database Design
Explain:

collections used

why each field exists

Extra Challenge Questions
Students must answer these theoretically:

Question 1

Why is storing plain passwords dangerous even in small applications?

Question 2

What is the difference between:

authentication

authorization

Give real-world examples.

Question 3

Why is JWT expiration important?

What could happen if tokens never expire?

Question 4

A hacker gets access to a valid JWT token.

What are 3 things you can implement to reduce damage?

Question 5

Why should logging systems be treated as sensitive infrastructure?
